> Maya acts like EBS

This is the **m**aya **ad**apter for Elastic Block Store *i.e. EBS*. This makes it 
super simple for existing EBS clients to talk to Maya `acting as an EBS Server`. 
One can use existing docker ebs volume driver or k8s ebs volume persistence 
plugins talk to maya with zero learning curve. In other words, infrastructure admins
or developers need not code anything to interact with `openebs`.
